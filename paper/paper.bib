	abstract = {Association rule mining is a method for identification of dependence rules between features in a transaction database. In the past years, researchers applied the method using features consisting of categorical attributes. Rarely, numerical attributes were used in these studies. In this paper, we present a novel approach for mining association based on differential evolution, where features consist of numerical as well as categorical attributes. Thus, the problem is presented as a single objective optimization problem, where support and confidence of association rules are combined into a fitness function in order to determine the quality of the mined association rules. Initial experiments on sport data show that the proposed solution is promising for future development. Further challenges and problems are also exposed in this paper.},

When we are confronted with solving this problem using nature-inspired algorithms, two issues emerge: How to shrink the values of the upper and lower bounds of attributes properly, and How to define the evaluation function properly? This paper proposes shrinking the interval of attributes using the so-called shrinking coefficient, while the evaluation function is defined as a weighted sum of support, confidence, inclusion and shrink coefficient. The four nature-inspired algorithms were applied on sport datasets generated by a random generator from the web. The results of the experiments revealed that, although there are differences between selecting a specific algorithm, they could be applied to the problem in practice.},

	abstract = {Numerical Association Rule Mining is a popular variant of Association Rule Mining, where numerical attributes are handled without discretization. This means that the algorithms for dealing with this problem can operate directly, not only with categorical, but also with numerical attributes. Until recently, a big portion of these algorithms were based on a stochastic nature-inspired population-based paradigm. As a result, evolutionary and swarm intelligence-based algorithms showed big efficiency for dealing with the problem. In line with this, the main mission of this chapter is to make a historical overview of swarm intelligence-based algorithms for Numerical Association Rule Mining, as well as to present the main features of these algorithms for the observed problem. A taxonomy of the algorithms was proposed on the basis of the applied features found in this overview. Challenges, waiting in the future, finish this paper.},

The association mining task consists of identifying the frequent itemsets, and then forming conditional implication rules among them. We present efficient algorithms for the discovery of frequent itemsets which forms the compute intensive phase of the task. The algorithms utilize the structural properties of frequent itemsets to facilitate fast discovery. The items are organized into a subset lattice search space, which is decomposed into small independent chunks or sublattices, which can be solved in memory. Efficient lattice traversal techniques are presented which quickly identify all the long frequent itemsets and their subsets if required. We also present the effect of using different database layout schemes combined with the proposed decomposition and traversal techniques. We experimentally compare the new algorithms against the previous approaches, obtaining improvements of more than an order of magnitude for our test databases.},

It has achieved great success in a plethora of applications such as market basket, computer networks, recommendation systems, and healthcare. In the past few years, evolutionary computation-based ARM has emerged as one of the most popular research areas for addressing the high computation time of traditional ARM. Although numerous papers have been published, there is no comprehensive analysis of existing evolutionary ARM methodologies. In this paper, we review emerging research of evolutionary computation for ARM. We discuss the applications on evolutionary computations for different types of ARM approaches including numerical rules, fuzzy rules, high-utility itemsets, class association rules, and rare association rules. Evolutionary ARM algorithms were classified into four main groups in terms of the evolutionary approach, including evolution-based, swarm intelligence-based, physics-inspired, and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the remaining challenges of evolutionary ARM and discuss its applications and future topics.},

	abstract = {Objective measures such as support, confidence, interest factor, correlation, and entropy are often used to evaluate the interestingness of association patterns. However, in many situations, these measures may provide conflicting information about the interestingness of a pattern. Data mining practitioners also tend to apply an objective measure without realizing that there may be better alternatives available for their application. In this paper, we describe several key properties one should examine in order to select the right measure for a given application. A comparative study of these properties is made using twenty-one measures that were originally developed in diverse fields such as statistics, social science, machine learning, and data mining. We show that depending on its properties, each measure is useful for some application, but not for others. We also demonstrate two scenarios in which many existing measures become consistent with each other, namely, when support-based pruning and a technique known as table standardization are applied. Finally, we present an algorithm for selecting a small set of patterns such that domain experts can find a measure that best fits their requirements by ranking this small set of patterns.},

One of the more important issues faced by developers is exposed as how to create more explainable Machine Learning models. In line with this, more explainable techniques need to be developed, where visual explanation also plays a more important role. This technique could also be applied successfully for explaining the results of Association Rule Mining.This Chapter focuses on two issues: (1) How to discover the relevant association rules, and (2) How to express relations between more attributes visually. For the solution of the first issue, the proposed method uses Differential Evolution, while Sankey diagrams are adopted to solve the second one. This method was applied to a transaction database containing data generated by an amateur cyclist in past seasons, using a mobile device worn during the realization of training sessions that is divided into four time periods. The results of visualization showed that a trend in improving performance of an athlete can be indicated by changing the attributes appearing in the selected association rules in different time periods.},

Typically, algorithms for Association Rule Mining generate a huge number of association rules, from which it is hard to extract structured knowledge and present this automatically in a form that would be suitable for the user. Recently, an information cartography has been proposed for creating structured summaries of information and visualizing with methodology called "metro maps". This was applied to several problem domains, where pattern mining was necessary. The aim of this study is to develop a method for automatic creation of metro maps of information obtained by Association Rule Mining and, thus, spread its applicability to the other machine learning methods. Although the proposed method consists of multiple steps, its core presents metro map construction that is defined in the study as an optimization problem, which is solved using an evolutionary algorithm. Finally, this was applied to four well-known UCI Machine Learning datasets and one sport dataset. Visualizing the resulted metro maps not only justifies that this is a suitable tool for presenting structured knowledge hidden in data, but also that they can tell stories to users.},

Similar as in the Tour de France cycling race, where the hill climbers have more chances to win the race when the race contains more hills to overcome, the virtual hill slopes, reflecting a probability of one attribute to be more interesting than the other, help a user to understand the relationships among attributes in a selected association rule.
