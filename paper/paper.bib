    abstract = {Association rule mining is a method for identification of dependence rules between features in a transaction database. In the past years, researchers applied the method using features consisting of categorical attributes. Rarely, numerical attributes were used in these studies. In this paper, we present a novel approach for mining association based on differential evolution, where features consist of numerical as well as categorical attributes. Thus, the problem is presented as a single objective optimization problem, where support and confidence of association rules are combined into a fitness function in order to determine the quality of the mined association rules. Initial experiments on sport data show that the proposed solution is promising for future development. Further challenges and problems are also exposed in this paper.},

    abstract = {Nowadays, only a few papers exist dealing with Association Rule Mining with numerical attributes. When we are confronted with solving this problem using nature-inspired algorithms, two issues emerge: How to shrink the values of the upper and lower bounds of attributes properly, and How to define the evaluation function properly? This paper proposes shrinking the interval of attributes using the so-called shrinking coefficient, while the evaluation function is defined as a weighted sum of support, confidence, inclusion and shrink coefficient. The four nature-inspired algorithms were applied on sport datasets generated by a random generator from the web. The results of the experiments revealed that, although there are differences between selecting a specific algorithm, they could be applied to the problem in practice.},

    abstract = {Numerical Association Rule Mining is a popular variant of Association Rule Mining, where numerical attributes are handled without discretization. This means that the algorithms for dealing with this problem can operate directly, not only with categorical, but also with numerical attributes. Until recently, a big portion of these algorithms were based on a stochastic nature-inspired population-based paradigm. As a result, evolutionary and swarm intelligence-based algorithms showed big efficiency for dealing with the problem. In line with this, the main mission of this chapter is to make a historical overview of swarm intelligence-based algorithms for Numerical Association Rule Mining, as well as to present the main features of these algorithms for the observed problem. A taxonomy of the algorithms was proposed on the basis of the applied features found in this overview. Challenges, waiting in the future, finish this paper.},

    abstract = {Association rule discovery has emerged as an important problem in knowledge discovery and data mining. The association mining task consists of identifying the frequent itemsets, and then forming conditional implication rules among them. We present efficient algorithms for the discovery of frequent itemsets which forms the compute intensive phase of the task. The algorithms utilize the structural properties of frequent itemsets to facilitate fast discovery. The items are organized into a subset lattice search space, which is decomposed into small independent chunks or sublattices, which can be solved in memory. Efficient lattice traversal techniques are presented which quickly identify all the long frequent itemsets and their subsets if required. We also present the effect of using different database layout schemes combined with the proposed decomposition and traversal techniques. We experimentally compare the new algorithms against the previous approaches, obtaining improvements of more than an order of magnitude for our test databases.},

    abstract = {Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a significant task for discovering frequent patterns in data mining. It has achieved great success in a plethora of applications such as market basket, computer networks, recommendation systems, and healthcare. In the past few years, evolutionary computation-based ARM has emerged as one of the most popular research areas for addressing the high computation time of traditional ARM. Although numerous papers have been published, there is no comprehensive analysis of existing evolutionary ARM methodologies. In this paper, we review emerging research of evolutionary computation for ARM. We discuss the applications on evolutionary computations for different types of ARM approaches including numerical rules, fuzzy rules, high-utility itemsets, class association rules, and rare association rules. Evolutionary ARM algorithms were classified into four main groups in terms of the evolutionary approach, including evolution-based, swarm intelligence-based, physics-inspired, and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the remaining challenges of evolutionary ARM and discuss its applications and future topics.},

    abstract = {Association Rule Mining belongs to one of the more prominent methods in Data Mining, where relations are looked for among features in a transaction database. Normally, algorithms for Association Rule Mining mine a lot of association rules, from which it is hard to extract knowledge. This paper proposes a new visualization method capable of extracting information hidden in a collection of association rules using numerical attributes, and presenting them in the form inspired by prominent cycling races (i.e., the Tour de France). Similar as in the Tour de France cycling race, where the hill climbers have more chances to win the race when the race contains more hills to overcome, the virtual hill slopes, reflecting a probability of one attribute to be more interesting than the other, help a user to understand the relationships among attributes in a selected association rule. The visualization method was tested on data obtained during the sports training sessions of a professional athlete that were processed by the algorithms for Association Rule Mining using numerical attributes.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a novel software framework for Association Rule Mining named uARMSolver. The framework is written fully in C++ and runs on all platforms. It allows users to preprocess their data in a transaction database, to make discretization of data, to search for association rules and to guide a presentation/visualization of the best rules found using external tools. As opposed to the existing software packages or frameworks, this also supports numerical and real-valued types of attributes besides the categorical ones. Mining the association rules is defined as an optimization and solved using the nature-inspired algorithms that can be incorporated easily. Because the algorithms normally discover a huge amount of association rules, the framework enables a modular inclusion of so-called visual guiders for extracting the knowledge hidden in data, and visualize these using external tools.},
